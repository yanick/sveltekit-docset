# Svelte kit docset

I like to be able to access my documentation offline via Zeal,
so I created a docset for sveltekit.

The feed for it is at 
`https://github.com/yanick/sveltekit-docset/releases/download/v0.0.1/svelte-kit.tgz`

You should be able to get at it by 
feeding this url to Zeal: `dash-feed://https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyanick%2Fsveltekit-docset%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fv0.0.1%2Fsvelte-kit.tgz`
